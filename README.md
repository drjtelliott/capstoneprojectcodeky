* In October 2019, FOX and WWE agreed to a five-year 205 million dollar deal. FOX would pay this amount to WWE for the right to air their television show, Smackdown. At the time of this deal,  WWE’s Smackdown was the sixth largest television audience for shows on cable. Additionally, Smackdown began airing live in 2016 instead of being pre-recorded. As a result of this change, the value for advertising on the show increased. Smackdown’s target demographic is between the age of 18 and 49. This audience demographic is the most desirable group for advertisers.
